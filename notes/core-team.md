Here is what I see the core team doing:

 1. Setting and holding the overall vision for what we want to do and
how we work.
     Examples:
       Deciding what projects to accept and include in our organization.
       Answering major questions from individual projects, like
copyright and vendor relations.

 2. Setting standards where we need them (low tech, low level of
interference with projects)
     Examples:
        How we use GitHub
        Roles within projects: Contributors, Committers, etc.

 3. Reviewing what's going on in the projects as needed.

 4. Recruiting / selecting people to run the individual projects.

 5. Electing some kind of chair or other overall leader.
