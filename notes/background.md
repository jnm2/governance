### Background of the Current Planning Efforts

Currently (May 2017) we are reviewing some options for how the NUnit
organization should govern itself. This document provides a bit of 
background.

NUnit has been around since 2000. I (Charlie) joined in 2002 and took
over project leadership in 2004. Starting in 2007, I created some design 
documents for what was to become NUnit 3 and presented the ideas at the
2008 Mono Gathering in Madrid.

For the early part of my time as the project lead, I was virtually the
only committer. However, in more recent years, we have managed to pull in
many more contributors and committers.

For all it's existence, NUnit has functioned using the well-known
"Benevolent Dictator" model. Back when I joined, the BD was Jim Newkirk
and I inherited the role when he left. More recently, Rob Prouse has often 
filled in for me and these days we have often function as joint leaders.

Beginning last year, I started to think about a number of issues:

1. Splitting things into multiple projects, each with their own
release schedule and developers. We have succeeded in splitting the
projects but much of the work on each project continues to be done 
by the same people.

2. Planning for succession for my own role in NUnit. I'd like to stay
involved but not at so much of a day to day level. I can imagine moving
more into the background over time, while still working on some pet
projects of my own.

3. Moving to more of a meritocracy in terms of both overall and individual
project governance. We have created what we call a _Core Team_ to oversee
the entire group of NUnit projects but we have not yet clearly defined
it's role. That role may evolve over time, of course.

Here is what I see the core team doing:

 1. Setting and holding the overall vision for what we want to do and
how we work.
     Examples:
       Deciding what projects to accept and include in our organization.
       Answering major questions from individual projects, like
copyright and vendor relations.

 2. Setting standards where we need them (low tech, low level of
interference with projects)
     Examples:
        How we use GitHub
        Roles within projects: Contributors, Committers, etc.

 3. Reviewing what's going on in the projects as needed.

 4. Recruiting / selecting people to run the individual projects.

 5. Electing some kind of chair or other overall leader.
