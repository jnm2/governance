## Roles and Responsibilities

### Users

Users are community members who have a need for the project. They are the most important members of the community and without them the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no special requirements.

The project asks its users to participate in the project and community as much as possible. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users. Common user contributions include (but are not limited to):

 * evangelising about the project (e.g. a link on a website and word-of-mouth awareness raising)
 * informing developers of strengths and weaknesses from a new user perspective
 * providing moral support (a ‘thank you’ goes a long way)
 * providing financial support (the software is open source, but its developers need to eat)

Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often become more and more involved. Such users may find themselves becoming contributors, as described in the next section.

### Contributors

Contributors are community members who contribute in concrete ways to the project. Anyone can become a contributor, and contributions can take many forms. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process.

In addition to their actions as users, contributors may also find themselves doing one or more of the following:

 * supporting new users (existing users are often the best people to support new users)
 * reporting bugs
 * identifying requirements
 * providing graphics and web design
 * programming
 * assisting with project infrastructure
 * writing documentation
 * fixing bugs
 * adding features

Contributors engage with the project through the issue tracker and mailing list, or by writing or editing documentation. They submit changes to the project itself via pull requests, which will be considered for inclusion in the project by existing committers (see next section). The developer mailing list and the issue tracker are the best places to ask for help when making that first contribution.

As contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, their profile within, and commitment to, the community will increase. They may be invited to the Contributors Team on GitHub, giving them a degree of public recognition for their work. At some stage, they may find themselves being nominated as committers on one of our software projects.

### Committers

Committers are community members who have shown that they are committed to the continued development of the project through ongoing engagement with the community. Committership allows contributors to more easily carry on with their project related activities by giving them write access to the one or more project repositories.

This does not mean that a committer is free to do what they want. Each process maintains a review process, which normally requires review of code by one other committer before merging a feature branch to master.

Anyone can become a committer; there are no special requirements, other than to have shown a willingness and ability to participate in the project as a team player. Typically, a potential committer will need to show that they have an understanding of the project, its objectives and its strategy. They will also have provided valuable contributions to the project over a period of time.

New committers can be nominated by any existing committer and must be approved by the individual project lead and confirmed by the Core Team. Removal of committer authority requires approval of the Core Team but may be instituted by the project lead subject to later approval in case of necessity.

A committer who shows an above-average level of contribution to the project, particularly with respect to its strategic direction and long-term health, may be nominated to become a member of the Core Team.

### Project Leads

The group of committers on a particular software project constitute a Project Team. Each individual project team is led by one of its committers. For smaller projects the lead may be the sole committer but it is recommended to have at leas one more in order to provide for future continuity. The project lead is responsible for development and maintenance of the software itself, setting up milestones and release plans, assigning priorities to issues, organizing the work of the project among the committers and making releases.

In fact, the lead makes most day-to-day decisions about the project, normally only referring major questrions of direction to the Core Team.

### Core Team

The Core Team is responsible for the NUnit Project and Community as a whole and has additional responsibilities over and above those of a committer or a project lead.

The key responsibiliy of the Core Team is to define and hold the vision and values of the NUnit Community and ensure that we stick to them. They should periodically review and if necessary update our vision and values documents and should ensure that all committers are aware of them.

The Core Team recruits, selects and appoints project leaders and confirms the appointment of committers on all projects. It also sets standards that are needed in order for our projects to interoperate with one another. This may include such things as coding standards, use of GitHub and inter-project decision making. It should endeavor to avoid micro-managing the software projects and should leave them as much freedom as is reasonable.

The Core Team will conduct a regular review of software each project, annually for core projects and every two years for others. Additional review may be called for if a project is having problems. The review should look at releases, bug fixing and other indications that the project is performing as desired.

The Core Team is called upon to resolve conflicts between software projects or if a consensus cannot be reached on an important decision within a single project. Individual projects may also refer important decisions to the Core Team, particularly those that reflect our community values. Issues of copyright and licensing are always referred to the core team.

The Core Team is responsible for approving, maintaining and amending as necessary these governance policies.

Membership in the Core Team is by invitation of the existing members. A nomination will result in discussion and possibly a vote by the existing members. As with all its decisions, the Core Team will attempt to reach a consensus on new members. If a vote is required, the new member must be approved by 2/3 of the membership.

Core Team members remain on the team until they choose to retire or until 2/3 of the members vote to remove them.

The initial composition of the Core Team is
 * Charlie Poole
 * Rob Prouse
 * Chris Maddock
 * Terje Sandstrom
 * Jamie Cansdale

### Core Team Chair

>**Reviewers:** I'm not sure what to call this role.

The Core Team Chair is a single individual, voted for by the Core Team members. Once someone has been appointed Chair, they remain in that role until they choose to retire, or the Core Team casts a two-thirds majority vote to remove them.

The Chair has no additional authority over other members of the Core Team: the role is that of a coordinator and facilitator. The Chair is also expected to ensure that all governance processes are adhered to, and has the casting vote when the project fails to reach consensus.

### Original Contributor 

The .NET Foundation, which we are considering joining, defines the role of Original Contributor as the person who seeds the project with the original software base. For the purposes of NUnit - at least NUnit 3 - that individual is identified as Charlie Poole who is the copyright holder for the core NUnit software components until they are assigned or licensed elsewhere.
